      <h1>How We Got Here</h1>
      <p>From starting elementary school to completing high school, I wasn't ever sure exactly what I wanted to do in
        life. All I knew was to study more and more to consistently achieve better grades. This was all just to please my family.
        There wasn't much sense of purpose just yet.</p>
  
      <p>Ever since starting my college applications during my senior year of high school, however, with the guidance from my
        two brothers, I was sure I wanted to pursue a degree and career in computer science. Honestly, it didn't take
        much to decide on what I wanted to do -- just some Youtube videos showcasing the endless possibilites of software development. </p>
  
      <p>Throughout college I was content, to say the least, about my decision back in high school. I'd like to take this time to thank my past self.
        With the knowledge and skills that I've gained from <em>most</em> courses I can do more than I could have
        ever imagined before! So, now we're here. I write about my life in hopes to contribute what I've learned throughout the years and gain
        further insight to a platform.

      <h1>A Passion of Mine</h1>
      <p>Throwback to middle school I realized that playing video games and cycling weren't the only forms of
        entertainment. It was then that I discovered an interest for volleyball. I wasn't exposed to the sport from social media
        or anything. This was just a result of brainstorming fun activities after school with my friends.
      </p>
  
      <p>It didn't take long for this interest to turn into a passion and from passion to love. I felt a rush everytime the ball made 
        contact with my hand and the sensation of "rolling" the ball over the net was just so addictive. At this point
        I was fairly new to the sport and knowing that I could be so much better gave me a strong sense of motivation to continuously
        practice.
      </p>
  
      <p>Fast forward to high school I maintained my love for volleyball. I would say that bumping and setting a
        volleyball
        became second-nature. I often looked back to see how much I improved which consistently fueled my urge to get
        even better. I believe this drive to improve rubbed on my peers and teammates, earning me the title as varsity
        captain. Ever since then, I have been playing from time to time, more leisurely, in open gyms.

      <h1>Serving my Community</h1>
      <p>My hometown is a place that I will forever indebted to for the love and kindness that its community holds. In
        order
        to pay them back, I enrolled in my school's Air Force JROTC program and some volunteering groups outside of school
        including Quincy Asian Resources Inc. With these groups of individuals who shared a similar goal as me, I was able
        to serve and give back to my community.
      </p>
  
      <p>The AFJROTC program hosted events that amounted to over 1000 hours of community service. Throughout my four years
        as a cadet, I was lucky enough to experience both the satisfaction of helping groups of people, as well as leading
        service groups. </p>
  
      <p>Well I hope this little snippet of my life has given you a sense of who I am. There is more to come with this page so
        please stay tuned. I am Michael and I thank you for taking your time to read about me.
