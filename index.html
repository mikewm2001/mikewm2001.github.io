      <h1>How We Got Here</h1>
      <p>From starting elementary school to the end of high school, I wasn't ever sure exactly what I wanted to do in
        life. All I knew was to study and to get better grades than I had last time in order to satisfy my parents.
        There wasn't much sense of purpose just yet.</p>
  
      <p>Ever since starting my college applications during my senior year of high school, however, with the guidance from
        two brothers, I was sure I wanted to pursue a degree and career in computer science. Honestly, it didn't take
        much to decide on what I wanted to do -- just some Youtube videos showcasing the powers of developing
        a program. </p>
  
      <p>Throughout college I was content, to say the least, about my decision back in high school. Thank you past-me!
        With the knowledge and skills that I've gained from <em>most</em> courses I can create more than I could have
        ever imagined before! So, now we're here. I write about my life in hopes to hear from someone that sees the beauty
        that I see in my upbringing.

      <h1>A Passion of Mine</h1>
      <p>Throwback to middle school I realized that playing video games and bike-riding weren't the only forms of
        entertainment. It was then that I discovered an interest for volleyball. I wasn't exposed to the sport from
        YouTube videos or social media but I simply wanted to do something after school with my friends.
      </p>
  
      <p>It didn't take long for this interest to turn into a passion and from passion to love. The sensation of "rolling"
        the ball over the net was addictive to say the least. I felt a rush everytime the ball made contact with my hand
        and
        at this point I was fairly new to the sport. Knowing that I could be so much better gave me more motivation to go
        to practices.
      </p>
  
      <p>Fast forward to high school I maintained my love for volleyball. I would say that bumping and setting a
        volleyball
        became second-nature. I often looked back to see how much I improved which consistently fueled the urge to get,
        well,
        even better. I believe this drive to improve along with seeing others improve earned me the position as varsity
        captain
        in high school. Ever since, I have been playing from time to time in an open gym.

      <h1>Serving my Community</h1>
      <p>My hometown is a place that I will forever indebted to for the love and kindness that its community holds. In
        order
        to pay them back, I enrolled in my school's Air Force JROTC program and some volunteering groups outside of school
        including Quincy Asian Resources Inc. With these groups of individuals who shared a similar goal as me, I was able
        to serve and give back to my community.
      </p>
  
      <p>The AFJROTC program hosted events that amounted to over 1000 hours of community service. Throughout my four years
        as a cadet, I was lucky enough to experience both the satisfaction of helping groups of people, as well as leading
        service groups. </p>
  
      <p>I hope this little snippet of my world has given you a sense of who I am. There is more to come with this page so
        please stay tuned. I am Michael and I thank you for taking your time to read about me. Godspeed.
